# User Management

## Description
We want user management! A simple login!

## Requirements
- We need a login page to do django session login, and log user in!
- We need dashboard page so when users logged in, they redirect to it
- On dashboard page, we need a side bar which has some dummy options for now, but the only thing that is working in logout button on bottom of it
- On top of side bar, we should user email, first name, and a password!
- Users will be registered on django admin, so prepare django admin for user creation as well

## Constraints
- We need first name, last name, email for each user
- If user logged out middle of a page, or entered a page with login access required, it needs to redirect it to login page with next=/x, then after login, redirect user back to /x
