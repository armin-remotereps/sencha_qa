# Create testing environment

## Description
We want an isolated environment to be able to run tests on it

## Requirements
- We should have a dockerfile so we can create a container from it for each test case
- On that dockerfile, we should have access to ssh, vnc, and playwright to be able to do tests (Will handle testing using AI on next tasks)


## Constraints
1. We should connect to docker socket (specified on .env)
2. We should launch a container from that specific docker file
3. We should connect to vnc, ssh, and playwright on that container to make sure everything is working
4. We should delete the container
5. We should disconnect from socket

**Note: This is a pre task for the next one, so you can create a management command and a document of how to do these steps using your code for next session to implement the main task**

**Note: The implementation note of this task is crucial, because another feature needs to read and understand it perfectly!**
