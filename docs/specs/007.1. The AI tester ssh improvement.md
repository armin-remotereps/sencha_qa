# AI Tester ssh improvement

## Description
Right now the agent can connect to the isolated env and interact with it but things are not so productive. We need to address each bug step by step. On this task, we want to fix ssh tool bugs

## Requirements
- Each tool may return huge amount of data, we should remove the unimportant sections, or summarize it. For example if a apt install command fails, we don't need to return all the lines, we need a third AI model here to understand the model, and return something like this to main model: status: FAILED, reason: xxxxx.
- Right now the ssh connection is getting opened and closed on each tool call, it's slow. we need to fix it
