# Agent vnc omni parser connection

## Description
Because of the vnc issue on finding coordinates, we have implemented the omni parser. Now we need to connect it to our vnc tools

## Requirements
- We're going to deploy this project on a server node for omni sharp so connection to omni sharp is through http call not the service calls
- For all vnc action like click and hover, for finding coordinates of the objects, we should call omni parser api to find the coords, then click using vnc tools

## Constraints
Be careful about different servers, the omni parser IS on another server, so we should have the URL and API KEY on .env as well

## Verification
We will ask ai agent to test the calculator, and see it can click on calculator buttons correctly
