## Agent context length manager

## Description
Right now, if AI agent goes out of context, it will fail its task, we need to summarize the context (compacting it) then continue

## Requirements
- The context size of our model is 16k, when we hit 95% of it, we will go for compacting
- On compacting, we will send context to the acting agent and ask to summarize it, then will remove previous messages from context
- We need correct logging to see when this happens

## Verification
Design a task that will go over the context limit, then pass it to me so I will ask AI agent to do it, and will see the result
