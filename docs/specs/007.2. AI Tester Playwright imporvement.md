# AI Tester Playwright improvement

## Description
We want to improve AI productivity on working with playwright for testing.

- Right now the on each tool call, a new context is opening which is super slow, we had the same problem with ssh, so we need a context manager here:
    - We should have a context manager to keep ssh and playwright connection on it, and do lazy creation each time calling a tool, so if a context is there, no need for recreating. Move ssh management to this context as well
    - When AI job is done, on exiting the agent loop, when context is closing, all ssh connections and playwright context should be closed
- Playwright screen shot tool return image which burns the context. We nee to change this tool so instead of returning image, agent can ask a question regarding to current status, like this: playwright_screenshot("Is the login button visible?") Then an internal visualization agent check the sc, check it against the question, then answer it
- Playwright click, fill, and all interaction tools should NOT take exact path of elements, instead they should give a description, like playwright_click("Click on login button") and on that tool, another ai read the elements, find the login button, then click on it, or it can answer by questions like: there are two login buttons, one for user and one for admin, which to click? Then main agent should call the tool with more specific detail: playwright_click("Click admin login button")

## Verification
For verification of the correct implementation, we need an E2E test, we need to ask agent to go to the google, search for weather for LA, and find the result for tomorrow
