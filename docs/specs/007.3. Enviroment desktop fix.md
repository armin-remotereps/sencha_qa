# Environment desktop fix

## Description
Right now, out isolated env doesn't have a desktop, when we connect to it using vnc it's showing a blank screen with a chromium on center

## Requirements
- We need an actual desktop to be able to browse apps and interact with them

## Constraints
- Do a deep research to see how to do this, you can check this doc: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-ubuntu-20-04 It's old but it is helpful

## Verification
- After you're finished, send me the commands to build and run the image, I'll let you know if it's fixed or not
