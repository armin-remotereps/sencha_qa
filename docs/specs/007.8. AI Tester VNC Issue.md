# AI Tester VNC issue

## Description
Right now, the AI tester is not connecting directly to vnc like what it's doing on playwright. We need to fix this and add it the ability to interact with VNC to do the asked job

## Requirement
- We should have same tools that we have on playwright on vnc. Like clicking a button or filling an input, and it should happen by an secondary AI under the tool, exactly as same as playwright tolls we have
- The connection to the vnc should be keep on the context manager that is keeping ssh and playwright connection RN
- Same as playwright, vnc tools should not return image, they should process image inside of them to not burn the context

## Verification
- I will give the agent a task to do it using vnc, if it success, then we're good to go
