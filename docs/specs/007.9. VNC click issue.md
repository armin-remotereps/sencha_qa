# VNC clicking issue

## Description
VNC tools like click and hover are not working because the AI model can not find where exactly it should click (finding coordinates are hard for it) and it make sense cause it's trying to blindly click a part of screen only by guessing. We want to implement OmniParser architecture to resolve this issue

## Requirement
- Create a separate service to apply omni parser parsing to screen shot of the screen, then call it from vnc tools (api call)
- Use microsoft omni parser
- We don't want to implement it with current system yet, our only focus should be implementing OmniParser APIs separately
- Implement it on a separate directory using fastapi (services/omniparser)

## Constraint
- We will run OmniParser on Nvidia GPUs

## Verification
Need to send some samples of my screen to the API, and validate the result coordinate
