# The tester AI

## Description
We want an AI agent to be able to do the test cases on the isolated env

## Requirements
- We already created a isolated environment on task 006. now we want an AI be able to act on that environment
- We should have a Tester Agent that has these tools: 1. manage shell, 2. manage the vnc itself like working with apps, 3. Manage playwright

## Constraints
- Our AI is DMR (Docker model runner) which the connection is specified on .env
- DMR doesn't have a reliable langchain package, so we should create the agent using DMR apis
- For this specific task, we use a light model (any 7b or 8b models)

## Verification:
1. Create an isolated env
2. AI should be able to connect to that env
3. AI should be able to install chess game on that env using ssh and playwright (download the .deb and install using shell)
4. AI Should be able to play chess for 20 seconds
