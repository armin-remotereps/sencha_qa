# Test runs UI

## Description
We have test runs and their relations with test cases, we need to add relation with project with missed from previous task, and implement the UI

## Requirements
- Each test run should have relation with project as well so we can show them correctly on frontend
- We should have ability to select multiple test cases, and create a new test run based on them
- We should have ability to select multiple test cases, and assign them to an existing test run
- We should have ability to see list of test runs (paginated)
- We should have ability to go to each test run and see list of runs
- We should go to each test run case, and see the logs, screen shots, the test case it self and the output
- We DO NOT want the run ability for now, we will create the trigger of runs on next task

## Verification
- Uncle bob for code review
- Nightmare tester for UI
- Test cases
