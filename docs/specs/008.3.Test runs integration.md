# Test runs integrations

## Description
Now it's time to connect the tester agent with test runs!

## Requirements
- We need a celery task to handle the `execute_test_run_test_case` for each testrun-testcase pivot.
- The celery task should be separate worker from upload worker, so 2 different workers
- for the whole test run, we should run a `group` with each pivot as a child, and when the group done, no matter with exception, failed, success, the status of test run should be change to done
- We should have a config to not miss even a single task

## Verification
I will run the test run to see the result
