# Test runs

## Description
User should be able to select all or some of its test cases from a project and run them as a test run

## Requirements
- User should be able to trigger a test run
- User should be able to see each project test runs
- Each test run has its statuses like pending, in progress, done, ....
- Each test run has its details which contains status of each test case
- Again each test case has pending, in progress, passed, failed
- User should see test runs changes live
- User should see tet runs-test cases changes live

## Constraints
- When a test run runs, for each test case underneath it, a celery task should be triggered
- On each celery task, a docker container from what we created on task 006 will be created
- An AI Agent from what we built on task 007 will start testing the test case on the environment
- After ai Agent is done, it will update the test case-test run result
- Container will be shut down and the test case on that test run will be marked as passed or failed

**Note: There should be an entity between test run and test case that has both of those ids, a status, and a result (at least)**

**Note: Design a failover so if celery restarts, no tasks miss**
