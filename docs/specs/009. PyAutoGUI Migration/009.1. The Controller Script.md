# The Controller script

## Description
We want to move from vnc tools, for that goal we need to implement a client so we can run it on the target system and control it using host, so Agent from host can take actions on the client

## Requirement
- We need a directory at the project for a new python project, it shouldn't be part of django apps, it should have its own requirements.txt and config
- It will connect to django project using websocket and do communications bidirectional
- It should connect with API key (will explain on constraints)
- It should be able to do these actions: 1. Click on a coordinate (left, right), 2. Hover on a coordinate, 3. Drag and drop from a coordinate to a coordinate (left, right), 4. Type, 5. Key press, 6. Take screen shot

## Constraints
- On opening connection it should send the client screen resolution, os, and the architecture (ARM64, AMD64, ...) to the server so agent tools can understand where exactly to click and also we can show it on dashboard
- API key will be `project` level, so each project will have its own unique API key, and when the client connects using that API key, server already knows which project it is assigned to
- This task is only for client, will do server implementations later
