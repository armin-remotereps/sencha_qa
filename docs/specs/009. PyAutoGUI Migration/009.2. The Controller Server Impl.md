# The Controller Server Impl

## Description
We already have the client for controlling remote machine, now we want to do the server side implementation

## Requirements
- We need to have a specific web socket on our server to be able to communicate with the client
- As mentioned on task 009.1 as well, the connection is based on project so when creating a new project, we need to generate a safe api key
- On the project page, we need to show the status of the agent that if an agent is connected or not, if connected, show the stats like os, arch, display resolution and if not connected, show the last connected time

## Implementation Constraints
- The agent connection status should be a column on db
- The websocket should be a separate async consumer
- There can't be more than one agent connected at the same time, so if an agent is connected and another connection request with the same API key comes in, we should reject the connection request

## Verification
- We should create a project, and ask nightmare tester to test if the connection status is showing correctly on panel, like connected, specs, last connected, ....
