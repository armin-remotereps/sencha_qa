# The union

## Description
Now we want to connect our AI agent with out python client and remove the vnc/ssh/playwright dependency

## Requirement
- From the environment, we should remove playwright, instead install normal chromium
- On the agent, we should replace all the tools with our controller consumer actions
- On running a test case, if no client is connected to that project, we should run a docker environment, if it is connected, we run tests on that environment
