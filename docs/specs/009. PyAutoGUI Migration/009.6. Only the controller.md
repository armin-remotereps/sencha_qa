# Only the controller

## Description
We don't need the docker support anymore, we only need to be able to run tests on the controller client

## Requirement
- Remove the docker dependencies, no need to run any container or create any images, delete dead code
- One big thing to consider is that we should not be able to run parallel tasks, each project should be running in sync, so 10 projects, 10 concurrency (if the concurrency of the celery allows)
- We need install script for controller client, one for windows, mac, and linux
- On UI, we need an ability do download the client as a zip, with a help to how to setup it, the install command should add the host, api key, all the connection information
