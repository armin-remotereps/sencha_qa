# AI Context Management

## Description
Right now our agent can't do heavy tasks cause it has a limited memory context, we should increase the context by available industry standard solutions

## Requirement
- We need to do summarization of context, like exactly what we're doing on `tool summarization`
- When we hit the threshold, we should summarize the context and replace it with old messages
- We need to use the model that we're using for tool summarization as well

## Verification
Define a heavy context task on the test_agent management command, I'll run it and will see if it can summarize it correctly or not
